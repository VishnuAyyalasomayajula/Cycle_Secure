Bicycle Theft Detection Application
“Our product will be a consumer product to help prevent the theft of street bicycles. Most
people secure their bicycles with locks that can be easily cut or picked meaning that their
bikes are relatively insecure. Our product would look to solve this problem. We would
produce a small system of sensors with communication capabilities that can be installed
directly and discreetly on the bicycle. Our solution would implement a GPS tracking
device accelerometer¨ and gyroscopic sensors to detect relevant changes in the state of
a parked bike and immediately notify users. The companion application will notify users
of these changes through push notifications. The application will allow users to track their
bike in the event immediate intervention is not possible"
